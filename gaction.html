Couple of things I found very interesting about this past Friday , the busiest shopping day of the year , none of the flyers listed xbox three sixty consoles , none listed anything for the three hundred and sixty , and the Best Buy I went to had an entire isle dedicated to the three hundred and sixty where you could buy all the games and accessories you could afford but noone was buying .
