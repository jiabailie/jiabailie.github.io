In fact I would recommend if you are going to buy any systems in the near future that you buy x sixty four systems as they will not only run Exchange two thousand and three now , but they will also have a slight performance improvement vs. a thirty two bit system and you will be ready to go to the next version of Exchange without having to buy a new system .
