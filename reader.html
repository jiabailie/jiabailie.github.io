Sure, Now I've got, I called a couple of T-Mobile stores and apparently the HTC One M8 for windows definitely does release tomorrow. The only problem is that at least for one of the stores there is a ups delay and so they might not actually have the phone in by tomorrow. And the other stores don't have their shipment in yet. Hopefully they get there shipment in later today.. Send, add more, or try again?
