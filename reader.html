Would you let me know if these are the meters for which we are manually moving around money from Tom to Ed for the residential portion of the Lufkin-Diboll volume? I believe that the industrial portion of this volume is included already as part of Ducote's deal, and I believe that the residential portion is volume which you determine and then move from Tom to Ed every month.
