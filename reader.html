Now it says, I called a couple of T-Mobile stores and apparently the HTC One M8 for windows definitely does release tomorrow. The only problem is that at least for one of the stores there is a ups delay and so they might not actually have the phone in by tomorrow. According to employees at the other stores I called them.. Send, add more, or try again?
