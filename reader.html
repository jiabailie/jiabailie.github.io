Team, I want to provide an update as to how we manage our passwords. First and foremost, the following are prohibited activities: 1. Do NOT write down passwords on whiteboards, paper or in plain text on your computer. No excel files, SharePoint files, etc. NOTE: You MAY use Kee Pass for your own, personal use; however, DO NOT put company passwords in these databases.
